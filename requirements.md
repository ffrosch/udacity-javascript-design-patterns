# Cat Clicker

## Requirements (v2)

### Visuals

- The application should display two cats. Each cat includes
    - the cat's name
    - a picture of the cat
    - text showing the number of clicks
- The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

### Interaction

- The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.
